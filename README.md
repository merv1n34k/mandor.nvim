# Mandor.nvim

Mandor - is your friend if you want to write simple notes, do a speed-noting on your math lecture, or write a complex scientific, professional grade papers for your journal. Its **main** purpose is to make your life **easier**, and not otherwise. It won't introduce you to new philosophy of notes taking, or make you use rare file formats.

I do this project for my personal needs, but hope other people will find it useful as well.

Things I need this project to do:
 - [ ] **Lua fan:** Mandor must be written in lua
 - [ ] **Markdown it:** write all your notes in Mandor's flavored markdown, but it must be easily converted to pure markdown, GitHub-flavored and Obsidian-flavored, (and other?) in a single command. **Must be *vice versa*!**
 - [ ] **Unleash power of LaTeX:** use LaTeX to render clean and beautiful documents. Rerender the note for a fast preview or compile the whole project in with simple commands.
 - [ ] **One command to rule them all:** Manage all your Mandors projects and their notes with bunch of commands, no more manual `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, etc.
 - [ ] **All configurable:** configure mandor's global behavior, or local configurations for each project. Mandor will understand both YAML and JSON and can export YAML to JSON if you need to.
 - [ ] **Nvim rocks!:** the plugin should be uploaded to luarocks. Can be installed with rocks.nvim.
 - [ ] **With extendability in mind:** Mandor will be consisted of a core and handlers. You can write your own handlers and attach them with a simple API.
 - [ ] **With version control:** Use git and git submodules to version control all your project with automatic or semi-automatic commits.
